# minigame-announce

Welcome,


This bot has everything to announce your minigame. 

If you enter /day485 and then the day, the day when you hold your minigame is stored in a file called day.txt.

To customize the minigames go to minigames.txt and change the 3 minigames, just make sure it looks like this:
1. Minigame1
2. Minigame2
3. Minigame3

### All commands:

/minigames for temporary status which minigames you will play on which day.

/minigames4 to let you know which minigames you are going to play on which day.

/day485 sets the day

Type ip to get the ip!
